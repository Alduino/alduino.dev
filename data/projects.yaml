    I haven’t been able to find a music player that is exactly how I like, so I decided to make my own.

    It’s a music player pretty much. Currently it can play music, and that’s about it.
    However I do plan to add more features, such as lyrics and playlists.

    RadiantPM is a self—hosted package manager, created for use internally at the Radiant Guild to
    host our private npm and nuget packages. It's designed around a plugin system so it can be extremely configurable,
    after an original attempt failed due to increasing development difficulty.
    
    Currently, the project is functional but early in development. It supports npm package hosting, and can be
    configured with various authorisation and storage methods.

    A collection of small experiments I’ve made, to test concepts and learn new things.
    To simplify the process of creating new experiments, I’ve created a framework that handles the boilerplate code,
    including the canvas, event handling, a component system, and coroutine management.

    The Radiant Guild is a community of comic artists, writers, and enthusiasts, currently with around 45 members.
    The website is a place for creators to share their work, and for readers to discover new comics.
    At the moment, the site is being redesigned and rebuilt from the ground up to be more performant and easier to
    develop.
    
    I’m working on the front-end of the site, including design, tooling, and development.
    My friend [AUSBird](https://github.com/ausbird) is creating the back-end.

    ZoneONE is a website that tracks public transport in south—east Queensland.
    As the site is specifically for SEQ, it is able to provide more detailed information specific to the region.
    
    I’m doing the development of the site, based on UI designs and algorithms created by my friend
    [pionsix](https://github.com/pionsix).
    
    Currently the site is still in early development, however there is an early version available at
    [zoneone.app](https://zoneone.app).
